# Computational neuroscience ArchLinux setup

## Important for non-Garuda users
You have to add `chaotic-aur` to your `pacman.conf`, either refer to the [online recipe](https://aur.chaotic.cx/), or use the bundled make command:

```shell
make chaotic
```

## Ideals
Provide scripts that will allow any neuroscientist, and hopefully other STEM fields the tools they need to quickly get to work.

### Motivation
Get more computational neuroscientists to switch away from Debian-based solutions to try other flavours of Linux. My journey started with ArchLinux, and I am hoping documenting it will help those the come after me!

## make commands

### Full
Includes everything including my own selection of installations

### Python
Use pyenv to install the python versions you want to use! `pyenv install <version>`, more info on the pyenv repository on GitHub.

### Flutter
The frontend framework that I use.

### Devops
Everything I use to develop and deploy my distrubuted applications.

### Gaming: Try to run your games in
Steam + Heroic-Launcher first, and if that doesn't work, try Lutris

## Issues?
Are very welcome!
