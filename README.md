# Computational neuroscience ArchLinux setup

I am using Garuda Linux that is downstream from ArchLinux. Most of these scripts should be applicable to every Arch-based distribution.

## Content

### pacman
Install everything you need for your workflows. I have catalogued everything based on domain of use.

## Ideals
Provide scripts that will allow any neuroscientist, and hopefully other STEM fields the tools they need to quickly get to work.

### Motivation
Get more computational neuroscientists to switch away from Debian-based solutions to try other flavours of Linux. My journey started with ArchLinux, and I am hoping documenting it will help those the come after me!

## Issues?
Are very welcome!
